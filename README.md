Changing parameters of some of the functions in BST to use Node rather than int. Functions using int will still be available but will be renamed.

Most have been changed. To fix any issues caused change the function names to have Int at the end e.g. "tree.findParentInt(DATA)".
Or change the input to the function to feature a node instead e.g. "tree.findParent(NODE)".

Working:
- Still working on changing the "tree.remove()" function.
- Add a function called "addNode(Node)" Where a the input is a Node object rather than an Int.
